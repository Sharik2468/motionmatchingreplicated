My Smooth Sync Demo Video: https://youtu.be/7MmN_9Jn-0s
i used the smooth sync plugin in the SmoothSync branch, then checked the Always Relevant in the character defaults. And changed something in the SmoothSync component. Thats it.

I changed the level a bit. 

I deleted the ECHO, Twinblast etc, just left the UE4, UE5 mannequins and the UEFN mannequin. For smaller file size.

CHANGED FILES:

CBP_SandboxCharacter (Event Graph), ABP_SandboxCharacter (Get AO Value function), BP_NotifyState_MontageBlendOut (i changed "Blend Out Conditions" input to "Force Blend Out"), DefaultLevel
