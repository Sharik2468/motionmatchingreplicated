Main branch is problematic because it does not have a smooth sync plugin. It causes other players to walk shakily in a game with a problematic internet connection. That's why I will not update the main branch anymore. I will build other versions on Smooth Sync.

I made the motion matching sample Multiplayer ready. Note: I dont know the dedicated server stuff.

FEATURES:


Replicated vault, mantle etc... Replicated sounds. 

I changed the level a bit. 

I deleted the ECHO, Twinblast etc, just left the UE4, UE5 mannequins and the UEFN mannequin. For smaller file size.

CHANGED FILES:

CBP_SandboxCharacter (Event Graph), ABP_SandboxCharacter (Get AO Value function), BP_NotifyState_MontageBlendOut (i changed "Blend Out Conditions" input to "Force Blend Out"), DefaultLevel



My Smooth Sync Demo Video: https://youtu.be/7MmN_9Jn-0s
i used the smooth sync plugin in the SmoothSync branch, then checked the Always Relevant in the character defaults. And changed something in the SmoothSync component. And coded a few things. Thats it.
